# SNAIL
`status: research iteraton: 1`

snail is a relayed protocol for portable unsupervised sneakernet devices.

This repository contains an implemenation that uses Wifi ~~NAN~~ for peer discovery and communication
in order to iterate and simplify.

## What you need
For now, an ESP32/S2 + battery and an MicroSD for storage.

Optional addons:
 - Button
 - RGB-Led
 - OLED Display (SH1107)

<!--
## Releases

> Don't ask, just flash!

[M5 Atom Lite]() [Firmware]()

## Flashing instructions

1. Setup [esp-idf](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf#developing-with-esp-idf)
2. Clone this repo `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/telamon/snail.git`
3. Build & flash `idf.py build && idf.py flash`

Prebuilt firmware might be available later.

## Design
Sneakernet is the art of transferring data using physical transportation and without the use of internet.
We'll rely on eventual message delivery within geographical bounds. _- unless you travel further_

The snail protocol itself is simple:  
**Search** for beacons, **Notify** presence, **Attach** to peer, **Inform** news, **Leave** and restart.


### Message Format
`TDB`

### Checking Inbox
`TDB`
Longpress on button interrupts the SNAIL cycle and puts the device into private mode.

Interaction with a smartphone.
- Android 8+ has builtin NAN support, Apple requires SoftAP?
- BLE
- USB-C

## References / Journey

`Iteration 1` - Bye NAN hello SWAP

Nan is truly glitchy. It's cool to sync clocks over a wide area but
it does not relay data or service info.
We're not building a mesh, we're bulding a _Swarm_.

- OUI & VSIE allows snail beacons to be distinguished between nodes.
- The dual v-netif APSTA mode allows efficient discovery and exchange.
- Always on AP solves mobile connectivity (for now).
